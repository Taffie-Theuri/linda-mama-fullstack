# Linda Mama

Welcome to the back-end of the Linda Mama project. This Rails API serves as the foundation for the Linda Mama healthcare application, providing data and functionality to the front-end.

# Getting Started

To set up and run the back-end:
* Clone this repository: git clone <repository_url>
* Navigate to the project directory: cd linda_mama_backend
* Install dependencies: bundle install
* Set up the database: rails db:migrate && rails db:seed
* Start the server: rails server
* You will be hosting the API on port 3000, so make sure that it is available.


# Authentication

User authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Make sure to include the JWT token in the headers of your API requests for authorized access.

# Database

The application uses PostgreSQL as the database.
